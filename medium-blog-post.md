# Building and Deploying Your First FastAPI Application on Vercel: A Complete Journey

When I first discovered FastAPI, I was amazed by how quickly I could build robust APIs. But then came the question that every developer faces: where do I deploy this thing? After trying various platforms, I found that Vercel offers one of the smoothest deployment experiences for FastAPI applications. Let me walk you through my journey of building and deploying a FastAPI app on Vercel, and hopefully save you some time along the way.

## Why FastAPI Caught My Attention

Before diving into the technical details, let me tell you why I chose FastAPI for this project. As someone who has worked with Flask and Django, I was looking for something that combined the simplicity of Flask with the robustness of Django, while also providing automatic API documentation. FastAPI delivered on all these fronts.

The framework is incredibly fast, thanks to its foundation on Starlette and Pydantic. But what really sold me was the automatic interactive API documentation. Imagine writing an API endpoint and getting Swagger UI documentation for free. That's exactly what FastAPI does.

## Starting Simple: The Core Application

Every great application starts with a simple idea. For this project, I wanted to create a minimal but functional API that could serve as a foundation for larger projects. Here's what I built:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def home():
    return {"msgs": "Welcome to my api."}

@app.get("/api/health")
def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy"}
```

This might look almost too simple, but there's beauty in simplicity. These two endpoints serve important purposes. The root endpoint provides a friendly welcome message, while the health check endpoint is crucial for monitoring and ensuring your application is running properly in production.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

One thing I learned early in my development career is that a good local development setup saves hours of debugging later. For this FastAPI project, I created a main.py file that handles the local development server:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
import uvicorn

load_dotenv()

PORT = int(os.getenv('PORT', 8000))
HOST = '0.0.0.0'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    uvicorn.run('app.api:app', host=HOST, port=PORT, reload=True)
```

The beauty of this setup is in its flexibility. By using environment variables, I can easily change the port without touching the code. The reload=True parameter is a developer's best friend because it automatically restarts the server whenever I make changes to the code.

## Managing Dependencies the Right Way

Python dependency management can be tricky, but for this project, I kept it simple with a requirements.txt file:

```
fastapi
uvicorn
python-dotenv
```

These three packages are all you need to get started. FastAPI provides the framework, Uvicorn serves as the ASGI server, and python-dotenv handles environment variables gracefully. I've seen projects with dozens of dependencies that could have been built with just these three.

## The Vercel Configuration: Where the Magic Happens

Here's where things get interesting. Vercel isn't just for Next.js applications; it handles Python beautifully too. The key is in the vercel.json configuration file:

```json
{
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
        {
            "src": "app/api.py",
            "use": "@vercel/python",
            "config": {
                "maxLambdaSize": "15mb"
            }
        }
    ],
    "routes": [
        {
            "src": "/(.*)",
            "dest": "app/api.py"
        }
    ]
}
```

This configuration tells Vercel exactly how to handle your Python application. The builds section specifies that we're using the Python runtime, while the routes section ensures that all incoming requests are directed to our FastAPI application.

## Local Development: Getting Your Hands Dirty

Running the application locally is straightforward. After setting up your virtual environment and installing dependencies, you can start the server with a simple command:

```bash
python main.py
```

What happens next is pretty amazing. Your terminal will show that the server is running, and you can visit http://localhost:8000 to see your API in action. But here's the real magic: navigate to http://localhost:8000/docs, and you'll find automatically generated interactive API documentation.

This documentation isn't just static; you can actually test your API endpoints directly from the browser. It's like having Postman built into your application.

## Testing Your API: Making Sure Everything Works

Before deploying anything to production, I always test thoroughly. For this simple API, you can test using curl commands or any HTTP client:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

The first command should return your welcome message, while the second confirms that your health check endpoint is working. These might seem like trivial tests, but they're the foundation of more complex testing strategies.

## Deployment: Taking Your App to the World

Deploying to Vercel is surprisingly simple, and I discovered there are actually two great ways to do it: manual deployment and automated deployment with GitHub Actions.

### Manual Deployment

For quick deployments and testing, the Vercel CLI is perfect. After installing the CLI and logging in, deployment is just one command away:

```bash
vercel
```

The CLI will ask you a few questions about your project, but the defaults usually work perfectly. Within minutes, your API is live on the internet with a custom URL that you can share with the world.

### Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions

But here's where things get really exciting. I set up automated deployment using GitHub Actions, and it completely changed my development workflow. Now every time I push code to the main branch, my application automatically deploys to Vercel.

The magic happens through a simple GitHub workflow file:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-args: '--prod'
```

Setting this up requires adding three secrets to your GitHub repository: your Vercel token, organization ID, and project ID. You can get these from your Vercel dashboard and the `.vercel/project.json` file that gets created when you link your project.

The beauty of this automated approach is that it creates a seamless development experience. I write code, push to GitHub, and within minutes my changes are live in production. No manual steps, no forgetting to deploy, no coordination issues with team members.

What I love about Vercel is that it automatically handles HTTPS, provides excellent performance through their global CDN, and offers generous free tier limits that are perfect for personal projects and small applications.

## Environment Variables: Keeping Secrets Safe

One thing I learned the hard way is the importance of proper environment variable management. In local development, I use a .env file:

```
PORT=8000
```

But in production on Vercel, you set these through their web dashboard. This separation ensures that sensitive information never gets committed to your repository while still allowing your application to be configurable.

## Monitoring and Health Checks: Keeping Your App Healthy

The health check endpoint I included isn't just for show. In production environments, load balancers and monitoring systems regularly ping these endpoints to ensure your application is responsive. It's a simple addition that can save you from discovering outages the hard way.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment: The Game Changer

Implementing GitHub Actions for automated deployment was one of those decisions that immediately improved my development experience. Before automation, deploying meant remembering to run commands, waiting for uploads, and sometimes forgetting to deploy important fixes.

Now, my workflow is beautifully simple:
1. Write code and commit changes
2. Push to the main branch
3. Watch GitHub Actions automatically deploy to Vercel
4. Receive a notification with the live URL

This automation brings several unexpected benefits. First, every deployment is tied to a specific commit, making it easy to track when changes went live. Second, the deployment process is consistent every time, eliminating human error. Third, team collaboration becomes effortless because anyone can deploy by simply merging their changes.

The GitHub Actions workflow also provides visibility into the deployment process. You can see exactly what happened during deployment, troubleshoot any issues, and even set up notifications to alert you when deployments succeed or fail.

## Extending Your Application: Room to Grow

While this example is minimal, it provides a solid foundation for growth. You can easily add new endpoints by extending the FastAPI application:

```python
@app.get("/api/users")
def get_users():
    return {"users": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]}
```

The beauty of FastAPI is that as you add more complex endpoints with request/response models, the automatic documentation grows with your application.

## Lessons Learned and Best Practices

Through building and deploying this application, I learned several valuable lessons:

First, start simple. It's tempting to add every feature you can think of, but a working simple application is better than a complex broken one.

Second, automate early. The automatic reload in development and the simple deployment process save countless hours over the lifetime of a project.

Third, documentation matters. The automatic API documentation that FastAPI provides isn't just nice to have; it's essential for any API that other developers will use.

Fourth, monitoring is crucial. That simple health check endpoint becomes invaluable when you're troubleshooting production issues at 2 AM.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

During my journey with this project, I encountered a few common issues that might trip up other developers:

Port conflicts can be frustrating, especially on development machines running multiple services. Using environment variables for port configuration solves this elegantly.

Import errors often occur when the Python path isn't set correctly. The project structure I used, with the FastAPI app in an app directory, helps maintain clean imports.

Deployment failures usually stem from missing dependencies or incorrect configuration. Double checking your requirements.txt and vercel.json files before deploying can save headaches.

GitHub Actions deployment can fail if the secrets aren't configured correctly. Make sure your VERCEL_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, and VERCEL_PROJECT_ID are properly set in your repository secrets. A common mistake is using the wrong branch name in the workflow trigger; ensure it matches your default branch (main vs master).

One lesson I learned the hard way: always test your GitHub Actions workflow with a small change first. There's nothing worse than discovering your automated deployment is broken when you need to push an urgent fix.

## The Future of Your API

This simple FastAPI application is just the beginning. You could add database integration with SQLAlchemy, implement user authentication with JWT tokens, add caching with Redis, or integrate with external APIs. The foundation is solid, and the deployment pipeline is established.
